## A better way to share photos
Piccy is an app I've built for iOS and Android that let's you share photos with your friends easily. You can create your own shared album and share it with your friends, allowing everyone to upload their images. 

A few handy filtering options quickly let you find the best shots and you can download and share them in original quality.

## Ideas for the future
I have many ideas to improve the app, but the problem is that I need to find time to work on it. I'm considering open-sourcing the project and try and find collaborators online. Some ideas I have are:
- Adding support for uploading video
- Adding support for live photos
- General UI improvements
- Improvements under the hood
