## About Be Resilient

Be Resilient is a Chistian ministry created by Sjaak van der Steen that helps people reach their full potential. Sjaak guides clients on a journey of **self-discovery and growth**, helping them overcome obstacles and achieve their personal and professional goals. 

Sjaak offers various services such as one-on-one coaching, group workshops, motivational speaking and all-inclusive retreats.

Be Resilient needed a website to connect with a wider audience, share information about their services and events, and build a community. The website had to have a blog where Sjaak shares tips and life lessons with his audience. Visitors also had to be able to sign up for the newsletter and get in touch with him.
