The current website was in need of an update. It needed a fresh look and do better in Google search results. Stephanie, the owner, gave me a lot of flexibility in coming up with a design for the new website. We also decided to create some new visual content!

## Creating content
It's no secret that I love playing around with camera's. I spent a morning taking pictures and filming around the restaurant. We used a lot of this content on the website. We took the video footage and edited into a short video that loops on the homepage and shared it on social media! ðŸ“¸

## A backend that makes managing content easy
Having an easy way to manage content on your website is crucial. You shouldn't have to call a web developer if you just want to change a picture or some text. All this can easily be managed from the website backend.

Petito changes up their menu regularly, for example when certain ingredients come into season. For Petito's menu section, I built a custom backend where dishes are devided into categories. Changing prices and descriptions is a breeze.
