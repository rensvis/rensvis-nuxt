## A beautiful farmhouse to wind down

I had the privilige to design and build the website for De Veenderij, a cherished family-owned farmhouse for three generations.

The website lets you experience the authentic feel of the accommodation. Interested visitors can **check availability and make a booking**.

De Veenderij underwent a meticulous restoration by the owners, Tjitske and Joost, after 30 years of neglect. The couple utilized local timber in the renovation, ultimately transforming the property into a **unique countryside rental**, inviting guests to fall in love with its tranquil ambiance.

## An intuitive backend
Managing bookings and updating the calendar is just as important as having a sleak design. The backend of the website does just that.

The website is **connected to other platforms** like Vakantieadressen.nl and BookingExperts so that guests always see the most up-to-date availability. Tjitske and Joost have full control over pricing and booking restrictions allowing them to make updates on the fly.

## The result
The new website encapsulates the charm of De Veenderij. Guests can easily book their stays and the backend provides an intuitive way for Tjitske and Joost to manage bookings and availability.

To sum up:

- A design that matches the look and feel of the holiday home
- An intuitive way to check availability and book a stay
- Showcase of photos and video to let the user experience the atmosphere
- Integration with other booking sites to automatically sync calendars
- An intuitive backend for the hosts to manage bookings and availability

Teaming up with Tjitske to bring her ideas to life was a fun ride! ðŸŽ¢
